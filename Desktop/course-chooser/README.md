# Epicodus Track Chooser

#### Branching Excercise 6/1/2018

#### By Matt Smith

## Description

This page is an excercise in branching and displaying content according to user input.  I used my previous css/appearance from my portfolio page because I feel pretty confident with appearance related CSS and I didn't want to sink a lot of time into reinventing the wheel establishing a new aesthetic.  Page appearance was kept clean and relatively frills-free since I anticipated a healthy amount of debugging (surprise; I was right) to get a finished project completed in the allowed time.  Focus was on .js scripts behaving correctly, not making a page with "wow" factor.  I'm getting the concepts of .js, but the syntax is still throwing me off, so a lot of the code was appropriated from this week's lessons.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* a HTML5 capable browser

## Known Bugs

* I initialized git on the wrong level resulting in the project being nested in /Desktop/.
* Logic is rudimentary, meant only to illustrate .js branching and should not be utilized in any meaningful, real world application of education track selection
* ().empty; is throwing an error in the console presumably because I have a var (result) being treated like a function.  Initial efforts to troubleshoot js syntax broke the code, so it'll stay for the time being.
