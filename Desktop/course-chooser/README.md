#### By Matt Smith

## Description

This page is an excercise in branching and displaying content according to user input.  I used my previous css/appearance from my portfolio page because I feel pretty confident with appearance related CSS and I didn't want to sink a lot of time into reinventing the wheel since I'm anticipating quite a bit of debugging for my business end logic and DOM behaviors.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* a HTML5 capable browser

## Known Bugs

I initialized git on the wrong level resulting in the project being nested in /Desktop/.  Logic is rudimentary and not overly useful and should not be utilized in any meaningful, real world application of education track selection
